# Fast Nuke
A lightweight macro that automates various actions in the online game [openfront.io](https://openfront.io/)

# Installation
Windows only, just download the portable .exe file.    

Might not work on other screens, hardcoded for 1920 x 1080.

# Usage
Once you open the app an icon will appear in your system tray. This means the script is active, you can manually pause or kill it there.


Keybinds:
- Exit app: Ctrl + X
- Fast nuke menu: Shift + N


You should only open the fast nuke menu with the mouse pointer hovering over the selected target since the scipt will save that location in the screen.

# Examples
Below are examples of how they are used.

## Fast Nuke
When you need to quickly overwhelm multiple SAM launchers.
- Take note, it will not allow you to overwhelm a SAM site that you cannot overcome normally. You can still do this manually with enough practice.

###### <p align='center'>Shift + N on target, type 2 to launch 2 nukes.</p>

## Fast Format
When you need a complex sequence of attacks done quickly.
- Instead of inputting a number, input "f" this will transition to another menu in format mode.
- Type in a sequence of code that the script will execute left to right, each letter corresponds to one launch.
- n: **atom bomb**
- h: **hydrogen bomb**

###### <p align='center'>Shift + N on target, type f, type code</p>

## Fast Build
When you are too lazy to build infrastructure manually.
- Instead of inputting a number, input "b" this will transition to another menu in buld mode.
- Type in a sequence of code that the script will execute left to right, each letter corresponds to one structure built.
- c: **city**
- l: **missile launcher**
- s: **sam launcher**
- w: **warship**
